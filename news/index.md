# Changelog

## bgms 0.2.0.0

### Breaking changes

- `update_method = "hamiltonian-mc"` is deprecated. Pure HMC with a
  fixed trajectory length will be removed in a future release. Use
  `update_method = "nuts"` instead. NUTS dynamically adapts trajectory
  length and is more reliable, especially with edge selection on GGM
  models.

- The `hmc_num_leapfrogs` argument is deprecated along with pure HMC.

- Pairwise interaction parameters for ordinal MRFs are now stored on
  association scale (half the sigma scale used in 0.1.6.3). Code that
  interprets raw pairwise posterior samples or sets `pairwise_scale`
  explicitly will need adjustment.

- Default `pairwise_scale` changed from 2.5 to 1 to match the
  association-scale reparameterization.

- [`extract_category_thresholds()`](https://bayesian-graphical-modelling-lab.github.io/bgms/reference/extract_category_thresholds.md)
  is deprecated in favor of
  [`extract_main_effects()`](https://bayesian-graphical-modelling-lab.github.io/bgms/reference/extract_main_effects.md),
  which covers category thresholds, continuous means, and precision
  diagonal entries.

### New features

- Gaussian graphical models (GGM):
  `bgm(x, variable_type = "continuous")` fits a GGM with Bayesian edge
  selection. Sampling uses the RATTLE constrained HMC algorithm to
  maintain positive-definiteness of the precision matrix.
- Mixed MRF models:
  [`bgm()`](https://bayesian-graphical-modelling-lab.github.io/bgms/reference/bgm.md)
  accepts a per-variable `variable_type` vector that mixes `"ordinal"`,
  `"blume-capel"`, and `"continuous"` types to estimate networks with
  both discrete and continuous variables.
  [`simulate.bgms()`](https://bayesian-graphical-modelling-lab.github.io/bgms/reference/simulate.bgms.md)
  and
  [`predict.bgms()`](https://bayesian-graphical-modelling-lab.github.io/bgms/reference/predict.bgms.md)
  also support mixed models.
- Missing data imputation: `na_action = "impute"` integrates over
  missing values during MCMC sampling for ordinal, continuous, and mixed
  models.
- [`extract_precision()`](https://bayesian-graphical-modelling-lab.github.io/bgms/reference/extract_precision.md):
  extract posterior precision matrix samples from GGM and mixed models.
- [`extract_partial_correlations()`](https://bayesian-graphical-modelling-lab.github.io/bgms/reference/extract_partial_correlations.md):
  extract posterior partial correlation samples from GGM and mixed
  models.
- [`extract_log_odds()`](https://bayesian-graphical-modelling-lab.github.io/bgms/reference/extract_log_odds.md):
  extract log-odds for discrete pairwise interactions.
- [`extract_main_effects()`](https://bayesian-graphical-modelling-lab.github.io/bgms/reference/extract_main_effects.md):
  extract main effect samples (category thresholds, continuous means,
  and precision diagonal).

### Other changes

- Refactored the C++ backend: unified model hierarchy (`BaseModel` →
  `GGMModel` / `OMRFModel` / `MixedMRFModel`), shared NUTS/HMC
  infrastructure, and fused log-posterior and gradient computation.
- Dropped `coda` from Imports; ESS and R-hat are now computed in C++
  with on-demand (lazy) evaluation, replacing the eager R-based
  computation from 0.1.6.3.
- `$` and `[[` accessors on fitted objects trigger lazy computation of
  MCMC diagnostics on first access.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed compilation failure on Alpine/musl: `mrf_simulation.cpp` relied
  on a transitive include for `<tbb/global_control.h>` that is not
  available on all platforms.
- Fixed stale gradient cache after missing data imputation caused NUTS
  to use outdated cached values for leapfrog integration.
- Fixed stale observation transpose after missing data imputation caused
  the pairwise gradient to use stale data.

- `baseline_category` now stored in fitted object for Blume-Capel
  simulation/prediction

### Bug fixes

- fixed matrix indexing for `posterior_mean_indicator`: now correctly
  maps C++ row-major order to R matrices
  ([\#77](https://github.com/Bayesian-Graphical-Modelling-Lab/bgms/issues/77))
- fixed mass matrix adaptation: now correctly uses variance instead of
  precision
- fixed step size heuristic: re-runs after mass matrix updates,
  resamples momentum each iteration
- fixed E-BFMI diagnostic: now uses actual accepted trajectory momentum
- fixed Blume-Capel interaction: uses centered scores `(c - ref)` in
  pseudolikelihood denominator

### Other changes

- NUTS: implemented generalized U-turn criterion following
  Betancourt (2017) and STAN
- NUTS: fused log-posterior and gradient computation eliminates
  redundant probability evaluations
- bgmCompare: BLAS-vectorized gradient computation for improved
  performance
- expanded test suite: input validation, extractor functions, S3
  methods, simulation, and numerical sanity tests
- improved warmup schedule: fixed buffers (75/25/50) with proportional
  fallback for short warmup
- edge selection warmup now within user budget: 85%/10%/5% split for
  stages 1-3a/3b/3c
- streamlined user messages: concise warnings, consolidated NUTS
  diagnostics
- E-BFMI threshold adjusted to 0.2 (standard)

### Deprecated

- [`mrfSampler()`](https://bayesian-graphical-modelling-lab.github.io/bgms/reference/mrfSampler.md)
  → use
  [`simulate_mrf()`](https://bayesian-graphical-modelling-lab.github.io/bgms/reference/simulate_mrf.md)

## bgms 0.1.5.0 (GitHub only)

### New features

- The bgmCompare function now allows for network comparison for two or
  more groups.
- The new summary_sbm function can be used to summarize the output from
  the bgm function with the “Stochastic-Block” prior.
- Two new data sets are included in the package: ADHD and Boredom.

### Other changes

- The bgm function with the “Stochastic-Block” prior can now also return
  the sampled allocations and block probabilities, and sample and return
  the number of blocks.
- The underlying R and c++ functions received a massive update to
  improve their efficiency and maintainance.
- Repository moved to the Bayesian Graphical Modelling Lab organization.
- Included custom c++ implementations for exp and log on Windows.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug in the bgmCompare function with selecting group
  differences of blume-capel parameters. Parameter differences that were
  not selected and should be fixed to zero were still updated.
- Fixed a bug in the bgmCompare function with handling the samples of
  blume-capel parameters. Output was not properly stored.
- Fixed a bug in the bgmCompare function with handling threshold
  estimation when missing categories and main_model = “Free”. The
  sufficient statistics and number of categories were not computed
  correctly.
- Partially fixed a bug in which the bgms package is slower on Windows
  than on Linux or MacOS. This is because the computation of exp and log
  using the gcc compiler for Windows is really slow. With a custom c++
  implementation, the speed is now closer to the speed achieved on Linux
  and MacOS.

## bgms 0.1.4.2

CRAN release: 2024-12-05

### Bug fixes

- fixed a bug with recoding data under the “collapse” condition

### Other changes

- when `selection = TRUE`, the burnin phase now runs `2 * burnin`
  iterations instead of `1 * burnin`. This ensures the chain starts with
  well-calibrated parameter values

  20 back to 2
