## Description

Provide a concise summary of the changes.

### Problem / Motivation

If this is a bug fix, describe the specific problem or edge case being
addressed. If this is a methodological update, explain the theoretical gap or
need for the change.

If helpful, add a minimal code example that demonstrates the problem.

```r
# Problem demonstration
```

### Proposed Changes / New Functionality

Describe the new functionality or logic introduced. Note whether this affects
prior specifications, sampling algorithms in `src/`, summary outputs, or user
facing R functions.

## Documentation and Release Notes

- [ ] Updated function documentation for any signature or behaviour changes
- [ ] Regenerated `man/*.Rd` files if roxygen comments changed
- [ ] Added or updated `NEWS.md` entry if the change affects users

## Testing and Validation

Describe the checks you ran and the main results.

- [ ] Added or updated tests in `tests/testthat/` when needed
