# Sample observations from the ordinal MRF

**\[deprecated\]**

`mrfSampler()` was renamed to
[`simulate_mrf()`](https://bayesian-graphical-modelling-lab.github.io/bgms/reference/simulate_mrf.md)
as of bgms 0.1.6.3 to follow the package's naming conventions.

## Usage

``` r
mrfSampler(
  num_states,
  num_variables,
  num_categories,
  pairwise,
  main,
  variable_type = "ordinal",
  baseline_category,
  iter = 1000,
  seed = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- num_states:

  The number of observations to be generated.

- num_variables:

  The number of variables in the MRF.

- num_categories:

  Either a positive integer or a vector of positive integers of length
  `num_variables`. The number of response categories on top of the base
  category: `num_categories = 1` generates binary states. Only used for
  ordinal and Blume-Capel variables; ignored when
  `variable_type = "continuous"`.

- pairwise:

  A symmetric `num_variables` by `num_variables` matrix. For ordinal and
  Blume-Capel variables, this contains the pairwise interaction
  parameters; only the off-diagonal elements are used. For continuous
  variables, this is the precision matrix \\\Omega\\ (including
  diagonal) and must be positive definite.

- main:

  For ordinal and Blume-Capel variables: a `num_variables` by
  `max(num_categories)` matrix of category thresholds. The elements in
  row `i` indicate the thresholds of variable `i`. If `num_categories`
  is a vector, only the first `num_categories[i]` elements are used in
  row `i`. If the Blume-Capel model is used for the category thresholds
  for variable `i`, then row `i` requires two values (details below);
  the first is \\\alpha\\, the linear contribution of the Blume-Capel
  model and the second is \\\beta\\, the quadratic contribution. For
  continuous variables: a numeric vector of length `num_variables`
  containing the means \\\mu\\ for each variable. Defaults to zeros if
  not supplied or if all values are zero.

- variable_type:

  What kind of variables are simulated? Can be a single character string
  specifying the variable type of all `p` variables at once or a vector
  of character strings of length `p` specifying the type for each
  variable separately. Currently, bgm supports `"ordinal"`,
  `"blume-capel"`, and `"continuous"`. Binary variables are
  automatically treated as `"ordinal"`. Ordinal and Blume-Capel
  variables can be mixed freely, but continuous variables cannot be
  mixed with ordinal or Blume-Capel variables. When
  `variable_type = "continuous"`, the function simulates from a Gaussian
  graphical model. Defaults to `variable_type = "ordinal"`.

- baseline_category:

  An integer vector of length `num_variables` specifying the
  baseline_category category that is used for the Blume-Capel model
  (details below). Can be any integer value between `0` and
  `num_categories` (or `num_categories[i]`).

- iter:

  The number of iterations used by the Gibbs sampler
  (ordinal/Blume-Capel variables only). The function provides the last
  state of the Gibbs sampler as output. Ignored for continuous
  variables. By default set to `1e3`.

- seed:

  Optional integer seed for reproducibility. If `NULL`, a seed is
  generated from R's random number generator (so
  [`set.seed()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Random.html) can be used before
  calling this function).

## Value

A matrix of simulated observations (see
[`simulate_mrf()`](https://bayesian-graphical-modelling-lab.github.io/bgms/reference/simulate_mrf.md)).
