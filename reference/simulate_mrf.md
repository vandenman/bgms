# Simulate Observations from a Markov Random Field

`simulate_mrf()` generates observations from a Markov Random Field using
user-specified parameters. For ordinal and Blume-Capel variables,
observations are generated via Gibbs sampling. For continuous variables
(Gaussian graphical model), observations are drawn directly from the
multivariate normal distribution implied by the precision matrix.

## Usage

``` r
simulate_mrf(
  num_states,
  num_variables,
  num_categories,
  pairwise,
  main,
  variable_type = "ordinal",
  baseline_category,
  iter = 1000,
  seed = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- num_states:

  The number of observations to be generated.

- num_variables:

  The number of variables in the MRF.

- num_categories:

  Either a positive integer or a vector of positive integers of length
  `num_variables`. The number of response categories on top of the base
  category: `num_categories = 1` generates binary states. Only used for
  ordinal and Blume-Capel variables; ignored when
  `variable_type = "continuous"`.

- pairwise:

  A symmetric `num_variables` by `num_variables` matrix. For ordinal and
  Blume-Capel variables, this contains the pairwise interaction
  parameters; only the off-diagonal elements are used. For continuous
  variables, this is the precision matrix \\\Omega\\ (including
  diagonal) and must be positive definite.

- main:

  For ordinal and Blume-Capel variables: a `num_variables` by
  `max(num_categories)` matrix of category thresholds. The elements in
  row `i` indicate the thresholds of variable `i`. If `num_categories`
  is a vector, only the first `num_categories[i]` elements are used in
  row `i`. If the Blume-Capel model is used for the category thresholds
  for variable `i`, then row `i` requires two values (details below);
  the first is \\\alpha\\, the linear contribution of the Blume-Capel
  model and the second is \\\beta\\, the quadratic contribution. For
  continuous variables: a numeric vector of length `num_variables`
  containing the means \\\mu\\ for each variable. Defaults to zeros if
  not supplied or if all values are zero.

- variable_type:

  What kind of variables are simulated? Can be a single character string
  specifying the variable type of all `p` variables at once or a vector
  of character strings of length `p` specifying the type for each
  variable separately. Currently, bgm supports `"ordinal"`,
  `"blume-capel"`, and `"continuous"`. Binary variables are
  automatically treated as `"ordinal"`. Ordinal and Blume-Capel
  variables can be mixed freely, but continuous variables cannot be
  mixed with ordinal or Blume-Capel variables. When
  `variable_type = "continuous"`, the function simulates from a Gaussian
  graphical model. Defaults to `variable_type = "ordinal"`.

- baseline_category:

  An integer vector of length `num_variables` specifying the
  baseline_category category that is used for the Blume-Capel model
  (details below). Can be any integer value between `0` and
  `num_categories` (or `num_categories[i]`).

- iter:

  The number of iterations used by the Gibbs sampler
  (ordinal/Blume-Capel variables only). The function provides the last
  state of the Gibbs sampler as output. Ignored for continuous
  variables. By default set to `1e3`.

- seed:

  Optional integer seed for reproducibility. If `NULL`, a seed is
  generated from R's random number generator (so
  [`set.seed()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Random.html) can be used before
  calling this function).

## Value

A `num_states` by `num_variables` matrix of simulated observations. For
ordinal/Blume-Capel variables, entries are non-negative integers. For
continuous variables, entries are real-valued.

## Details

**Ordinal / Blume-Capel variables:** The Gibbs sampler is initiated with
random values from the response options, after which it proceeds by
simulating states for each variable from its full conditional
distribution given the other variable states.

**Continuous variables (GGM):** Observations are drawn from \\N(\mu,
\Omega^{-1})\\ where \\\Omega\\ is the precision matrix specified via
`pairwise` and \\\mu\\ is the means vector specified via `main`. No
Gibbs sampling is needed; `iter` is ignored.

There are two modeling options for the category thresholds. The default
option assumes that the category thresholds are free, except that the
first threshold is set to zero for identification. The user then only
needs to specify the thresholds for the remaining response categories.
This option is useful for any type of ordinal variable and gives the
user the most freedom in specifying their model.

The Blume-Capel option is specifically designed for ordinal variables
that have a special type of baseline_category category, such as the
neutral category in a Likert scale. The Blume-Capel model specifies the
following quadratic model for the threshold parameters:
\$\$\mu\_{\text{c}} = \alpha (\text{c} - \text{r}) + \beta (\text{c} -
\text{r})^2\$\$ where \\\mu\_{\text{c}}\\ is the threshold for category
c (which now includes zero), \\\alpha\\ offers a linear trend across
categories (increasing threshold values if \\\alpha \> 0\\ and
decreasing threshold values if \\\alpha \<0\\), if \\\beta \< 0\\, it
offers an increasing penalty for responding in a category further away
from the baseline_category category r, while \\\beta \> 0\\ suggests a
preference for responding in the baseline_category category.
